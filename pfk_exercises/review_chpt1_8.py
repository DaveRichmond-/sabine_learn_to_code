# Chapter 2: Variables --------------->

# how much money would you have in your piggy bank, if you had 7 one dollar bills, 34 quarters, 71 dimes, 112 nickels and 42 pennies?
# create an equation below to calculate the result and store it in a variable called TOTAL.
# you can use the variables that I created for you:

value_penny = 0.01
value_nickel = 0.05
value_dime = 0.10
value_quarter = 0.25
value_dollar = 1.0

# TOTAL =

# Chapter 3: Strings, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries --------------->

# create a string in a variable called STRING_1
# STRING_1 = 

# create another string that contains an apostrophe
# STRING_2 = 

# create a string that contains the number stored in the variable MY_NUMBER (hint: you need to convert the number to a string as well)
MY_NUMBER = 3.1415
# STRING_3 = 

# create a list containing both strings and numbers
# LIST_1 = 

# create a list containing another list
# LIST_2 = 

# create a list, and then assign the variable MY_VARIABLE to the first position in the list
MY_VARIABLE = 'testing, 123'
# LIST_3

# create two lists and the "append" them and assign the result to a new list
# LIST_4 = 
# LIST_5 = 
# LIST_6 = 

# create a tuple
# TUPLE_1 = 

# create a dictionary containing at least three key:value pairs
# DICT_1 = 

# Chapter 4+6: If / Else statements + Functions --------------->

# write a function called FIGHT_OR_FLIGHT that takes a single input variable called INPUT_1.  If INPUT_1 is "monster" then it returns "FIGHT".  If INPUT_1 is "dragon" then it returns "FLIGHT".  And if INPUT_1 = "pbj" then it returns "EAT".



# Chapter 5+6: Loops + Functions --------------->

# write a function called LIST_COUNTER that takes a single input variable called INPUT_LIST and adds up all of the numbers contained in the list (using a for loop).



# write a function called SUM_TO_1000 that returns the sum of every number from 1 to 1000 (using a while loop).
